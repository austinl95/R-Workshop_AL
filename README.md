This is a 10 lessons-R workshop series that I led in Spring Semester of 2020 at Washington University School of Medicine. Each topic has both a lesson and an answer key except for lesson 10 (linear modeling). 

#Lesson 1 : Introduction to R 
#Lesson 2 : Plotting Data
#Lesson 3 : Data Visualization
#Lesson 4 : Data Wrangling
#Lesson 5 : Data Cleaning
#Lesson 6 : Correlation & Covariance
#Lesson 7 : Hypothesis Testing
#Lesson 8 : Basic Programming
#Lesson 9 : ANOVA
#Lesson 10 : Linear Models


Big thanks to Dr. Katie Cousins who shared her R lesson materials with me. This Readme.file is still a work in progress.
